There were 7 errors returned from the code analyzier. The first 6 were related to the String parser that we
used for the level builder. We chose to supress these warnings because the input files will be a consistent
format so the parser will also be consistent. The final warning was unrelated to our code and was related to
the FxCop Analyizer.
