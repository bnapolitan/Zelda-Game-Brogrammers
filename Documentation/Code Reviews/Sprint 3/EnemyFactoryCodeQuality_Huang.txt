Specific comments on code quality:
The functions in this file are very basic in the whole project. 
In the levelbuilder, project need function in the EnemyFactory to build visualization and collision of enemy item. 
Therefore, Changes in this file will affect the construction of the aspect of level in the entire project. 
Because functions are separate, the addition and reduction of functions have no effect on the whole function. 
As for the Collison function in this file, it is easy to change. 
To sum up, these code functions are highly targeted. 
They are mainly building enemies from sprit picture and build relationship of collision among enemies.
