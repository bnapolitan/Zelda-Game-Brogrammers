Comments on Readability:

	- variables in class are clearly named, it is easy to tell their purpose

	- clear use for a Singleton
	
	- method names all clearly named according to purpose with short number of arguments

	- clear when methods from other classes being called, making it easy to trace path of logic

	- nested for each with nested if might be only section slightly difficult to read
		-is still probably the easiest way to deal with collisions and variable names make
