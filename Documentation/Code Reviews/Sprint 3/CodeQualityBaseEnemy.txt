The first thing I notice about this class is that it implements the IEnemy Interface. Thus it has to implement
the two methods that are defined in IEnemy and have a damage variable. Both of the inherited methods are set as
abstract to be handled by the other classes that implement BaseEnemy. Some of the notable fields include a
collider and a sprite object. While these increase coupling they are needed for the BaseEnemy class and have
high cohesion. All the other fields keep track of the state of the enemy also increasing cohesion. The largest
method in the class is the OnCollide method which does basic collision handling for walls and projectiles. These
can be overridden in classes that implement BaseEnemy for more fleshed out collision handling. One thing that I
would change about this class is removing the second position field as it useless.
