File Being Reviewed: CollisionHandler.cs

Code Quality Comments: 

	- good separation of mask/layer enum and logic
	
	- clear way to add and remove items from appropriate lists and dictionaries

	- clear defined way to track all items and check relevant collisions

	- good use of making class static and making variables/contructor private, not allowing client to change it unnecessarily

	- only slightly unclean part is checking types of collidable to determine which list to delete from in game
		- game class could possibly have a single list with alll types of items
		- could clean up code across multiple classes and have less calls to update/draw, less lists
