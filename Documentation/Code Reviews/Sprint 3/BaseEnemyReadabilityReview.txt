At the beginning of the class there are many fields that are used to keep track for different aspects of the
enemy. One thing that stood out to me is that there are two position fields, one is public, one is private,
and both are being used. This definitly makes the class a little more confusing and harder to read. Moving on
to the methods the draw method is very clean, only calling the gameObjects and Colliders draw methods. The
takeDamage and Attack methods are both abstract and implemented elsewhere simplifying the class. Finally the
onCollide method, which handles enemy collisions, is relativly clean. It is broken into two parts one for 
projectile collisions and one for environment collisions, but the method is short and very readable because
the fields that are used are clear and well defined.
