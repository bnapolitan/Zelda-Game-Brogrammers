Specific comments on what is readable: 
As for the readability of this file, this file contains many functions. 
However, every function is very easy to understand its meaning and function by their names. 
Therefore, each of enemy item which was created in this file is easy to identify. 
Moreover, each function follows the same construction method. 
As for the collision function ‘RegisterEnemyForCollision’, it just uses one-line code to implement function. 
In general, the code is highly readable.
