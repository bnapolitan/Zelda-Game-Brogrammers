Specific comments on code quality: 
	
	This file is one of multiple files which implement Animated Enemys. Those files are very similar in structure. 

	In this file, there is no redundant code. Except for variable initializations and methods declarations, only Draw(), Aquamentus(), and Update() have content, which are necessary to implement the  Aquamentus class.

	Good and clear use of if-condition inside Update(), which makes the object able to move around. It's a easy and clean way to do so.


A hypothetical change£º

	If I have to make a change, I think instead of put many animated enemies in multiple files, we can implement a class for all animated enemies, and create instances for different enemies. This can make the project shorter and easier to understand.
