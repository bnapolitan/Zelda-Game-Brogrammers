The first thing that I notice about this class is that it is a singleton class. This is because we are never going to need
more than one enviroment factory so making this class a singleton is appropriate. There are three fields one holds the only
instance of the class and is called instance. The other two fields hold the texture altases. The constructor of the class
does not do anything which is appropiate for a singleton class. The loadAllTextures method takes the content manager as a 
parameter and loads the textures into the texture atlas fields. All remaining methods created the different requested
environment pieces. This class has very high cohesion because it is doing many operations that are very similar. Each method
that creates an environment object takes the position as a parameter, creates the object and its sprite the returns the newly
created IGameObject. All methods in the class are short and do a specific job. The class is also loosely coupled as it does
not have refernces to any other classes.
