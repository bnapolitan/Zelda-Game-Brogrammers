Specific comments on code quality: 

This file is really important, because each Sprint project need this file to animate sprites. 
All the code in this file looks well. 
In the future, as for each Sprint project, it will be easy to make some changes 
in this file and these changes wonâ€™t make seriously conflict for the whole project. 
For example, changes in the function update will not affect other files.
