Sprint #: 2
File being reviewed: FixedItem.cs
Author of file under review: Xueyang Li


Comments on code maintainability/quality:
This file falls in line with our structure of sprites. However, there are concerns I have with some aspects of the file that don't seem maintainable.

For starters, FixedItem contains a controller for items and registers commands. This does not appear cohesive as the sprite is not very linked to commands and this should likely be handled elsewhere.

Second, the file contains a boolean for "FairyMov" which is a specific case. This would likely be better suited in its own class for the fairy instead, as most of the items won't use that boolean.

The class contains position variables hard-coded in. Despite the application in this current sprint, it will be more helpful down the line to be able to put the position in as a parameter.

Finally, the sprites don't have game objects, which will be needed down the line for interactivity.


Hypothetical change:
A potential change would be to extrapolate multiple sprites for specific cases or reusing the already established sprite structures for the items (FixedSprite.cs, AnimatedSprite.cs).
Game objects should be linked to sprites, and functions should be designed to be more modular (parameters).
