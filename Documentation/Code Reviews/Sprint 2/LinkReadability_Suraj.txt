Comments on Readability: 

-Properties and private variables have clear names that show purpose 
	-There is a private collider variable and a public Collider property, not sure what the difference is 

-Initialization of variables in constructor is clear, no unknown constants or method calls 

-Update and Draw both just contain calls to Update and Draw of relevant objects, making this section clear to understand 

-Majority of methods just contain corresponding method call in LinkStateMachine 
	-Makes reading Link class very easy 
	-Movement logic contained within another class so user does not have to see all of it contained within main Link class (which would be long and tedious to follow) 

-Whitespace and indentation makes code easy to follow 

-Only confusing part might be understanding what ToPoint() does to update collider location without comment explaining
