Overall the class is very readable. It contains three fields all with names that describe their purpose accurately.
This class has many methods that all have simple but readable names. The fields that hold the atlases are helpful
to describe where each texture is coming from while also making the class more readable. One thing that could help
improve readability would be to make code blocks to hold methods that make similar items such as grouping tiles
together or grouping doors together. For the most part all methods follow the same structure so if you understand
how one method works you understand how all of the methods work. There are also no formatting or other related
issues with the class.
