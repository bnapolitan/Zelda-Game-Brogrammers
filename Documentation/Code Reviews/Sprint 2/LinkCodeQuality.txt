Code Quality Comments: 

-Overall, good use of loose coupling, only having references to things that are necessary 
	-Would move controller logic out of link class 
	-This would reduce some coupling 

-Instead of multiple different Draw and Update calls, can also make a list of GameObjects/Weapons and call Update and Draw on each object within the list 

-Good encapsulation of Link’s movement logic 
	-All small details not shown within main Link class 
	-Instead handled in other state classes controlled by the LinkStateMachine 
	-Also helps with maintainability in the future 
	-If changes need to be made, you just need to create a new State class and add a simple method call to the state machine 
	-Reduces amount of changes that would have to go into main Link class versus if you’d decided to keep movement logic in class 

-To help with user’s understanding, maybe rename IProjectile to IWeapon and just have projectiles deal with a method that controls the movement away from/back to the character 
	-Simple name change that would allow users to understand why current weapon, which isn’t necessarily a “projectile” in the future, would fit under the broader category of weapon
