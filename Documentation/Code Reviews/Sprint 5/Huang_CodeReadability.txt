Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

The name of variable is easy to understand What its role is in the code. Each of function name
is clear. And construction of each function is structured which is easy to understand the logic 
of this function. The long function is divided into several segments, which will greatly improve 
readability. There is no empty function. To sum up, there is no problem with the readability
of this code.
