Comments on readability:
Variable names are descriptive for the most part and explain what they are without requiring comments.

There are a lot of unnecessary/inconsistent uses of the this keyword which makes reading the code a bit harder to follow and figure out where variables are coming from.

It also doesn't make sense for the title screne sprite to be created in the RegisterGame function. Speaking of which, there's no need for this class to need a FinalGame field as it's never used, which adds to confusion.
