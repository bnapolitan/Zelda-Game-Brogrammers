Specific comments on code quality:

This file mainly focused on the pad controllers. The purpose of each function is clear. As for
the function update(), it is good to use foreach to improve the quality of this code. It makes
the code simple. And for the function RegisterCommand, it is good to use switch logic to
separate three different states. However, there are two RegisterCommand functions in this
file, although they have different variables. To sum up, the whole code has no big problem in
quality.
