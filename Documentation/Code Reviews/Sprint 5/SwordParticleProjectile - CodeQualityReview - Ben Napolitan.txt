Comments on code maintainability/quality:
This file is well set-up, extending BasePlayerProjectile and implementing only the functionality needed with out duplicating code.

Update, OnCollide, and Deactivate all perform only actions relevent to their title. Launch is good for the most part, however, setting Speed
should likely be done in the constructor instead. Also, creating a second variable named speed (with a lowercase 's') can be confusing. It would 
make more sense to set 'Speed' once in the constructor from a configuration file value.

Besides that I have no quality recommendations.


Hypothetical change:
Remove 'speed' local variable
Set 'Speed = Configuration.{filename}.SwordProjectileSpeed' in the constructor
