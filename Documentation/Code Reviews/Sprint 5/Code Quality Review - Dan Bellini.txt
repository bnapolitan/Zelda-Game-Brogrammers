Sprint 5
LevelManager.cs

Time Taken: 15 min

For this code quality review I will be taking another look at level manager because
it got a large update and many of our new features this sprint did not require a new
class. Importantly many of these updates were able to take advantage of many of the 
good code quality practices I mentioned in the inital review of this class. For
example, when adding bombed doors and explodable wall functionality it was very straight
forward to change the collision handlr layers because of how the class was written
initially. Also when adding the survival room, and its special features, the switch
case in the CheckSpecials method made it very easy to add a new room with specials
as I also mentioned in the earlier review of this class. The important thing to take
away from this review is that making code easily maintainable is an important part
of the development process so you can go back and change it later. That importance 
really showed in this class in particular.
