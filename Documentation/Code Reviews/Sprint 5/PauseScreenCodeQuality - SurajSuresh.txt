Code Quality Comments: 

	- Number of magic numbers in math could be reduced with constants in configuration files

	- Clear if tests in AddToAcquireItems following a similar pattern, makes it easy to follow

	- Really like how you did the UpdateInventoryMap() method and set up the matrices

	- Good use of lists to store elements of interest for different purposes

	- Access to instance of FinalGame directly creates some coupling
		-could be reduced with a utility class that keeps track of current room information
		-could also just use instance of LavelManager to get this information instead of the game

	- Most methods are clear and have a single purpose, resulting in generally good cohesion

	- Register game seems to call methods which perform other tasks, resulting in slightly lowered cohesion in this one method

	- Class looks good and could be even better with improvements above
