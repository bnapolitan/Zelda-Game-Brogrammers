Comments:
Variables are well-named and functions take care of functionality contained under their name which makes this file easily readable.

The Launch() method has many statements in a row with no spacing. Since some of them are independent, maybe some spaces should be added to group
statements that are related to each other (like the temporary 'rect' and 'collider' variables).
