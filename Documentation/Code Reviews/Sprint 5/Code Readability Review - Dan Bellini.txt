Sprint 5
LevelManager.cs
File Author: Suraj Suresh
Time Taken: 15 min

Many of our new features this sprint came in changes to old files rather than creating
completely new files. Due to this I will be rereviewing LevelManager with the update
that adds functionality for the survival room. I will focus mostly on the new code, but
may make comments on old code. With the survival room update, there were only two new
fields needed to add this functionality. One tracks the number of waves and one tracks 
if the room door is released. These are both very readable considering I could figure 
out their function from reading the names. The majority of the class remains unchanged
for most of the methods. I would still reccomend deleting the GetLevel method and just
using GetLevelWithOffset and have an offset of zero. This would greatly simplify the
class and make it more readable. The major change comes in the CheckSpecials method.
The switch statement that is used in this method makes it very easy to find where the 
code for this survival room logic is. The first if statement is easy to read because of
the well named variables. You can then easily tell it checks for the number of waves and
if the door should be opened. Otherwise the game adds new randomized enemies to the level.
All of this code is very easy to understand from even a glance because of the well named
variables, and code structure that allows for me to follow control flow and logic very 
easily. I think that this is still a very readable class after its updates.
