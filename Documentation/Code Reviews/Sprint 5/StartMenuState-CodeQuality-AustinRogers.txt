Comments on code quality:

The first quality issue that stands out is that this file is written as a singleton. It seems unnecessary to have the start menu always loaded in the game as there are no features of it which need to be persistent; it would make much more sense for the main game class to create an instance of the start menu when it needs to appear. 

There is also some unnecessary coupling with SpriteAtlas, AnimatedSprite, and FinalGame. The title sprites texture and sprite creation should occur in a factory as the rest of object creation in our game does. There's no reason that this class should have a FinalGame field as it does not use it except to access the Content once (which again, should occur in a factory, not here).


Hypothetical change:
Perhaps we would want to add more features than simply jumping straight into game, like a settings menu or credits. This start menu has no functionality of its own, it just draws a sprite of the title screen, so making these changes would require a complete overhaul.
