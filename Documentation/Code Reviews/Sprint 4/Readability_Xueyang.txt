Comment:
	This file is used to manage the HUD. 

	All the variables and methods are well defined with straightforward name, which makes them easy to understand.

	Whitespace makes codes easy to read.

	Most methods are short and easy to debug, except for those functions with list assignment or calculation, which cannot be avoided.
	The structure of methods is clear and easy to follow.

	In the method "UpdateHearts", there are some calculations. I think it would be better if the author expians the meaning of them. 

	In general, this file is of good readability.
