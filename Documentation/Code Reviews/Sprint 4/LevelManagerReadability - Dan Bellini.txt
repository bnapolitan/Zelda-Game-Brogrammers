File being reviewed (Readability): LevelManager.cs
File Author: Suraj Suresh

The first thing that I see in the class is the instance data for the class. All of these variables are well named and descriptive. The only thing
that was slightly confusing at first was the function of the levelDict dictionary, its purpose is not completely clear from just the name. The
first methond, GetLevel, is very simple as it registers all the collidables for each level, and returns the level from the dictionary. 
This could have probably been named to something more related to the collidables because that is what the method does most of. GetLevelWithOffset
has the same functionality as GetLevel but adding an offset to all of the gameObjects loaded to the level. AddObject to level is also a very
well written method, adding the object passed into it to the correct list based on its type. RemoveObjectFromCurrentLevel is also very well
written as it does essentially the reverse of AddObject. ResetLevels is a very simple and readable method, as is GenerateLevels. CheckSpecials
is the longest and most compicated method in the class but is well split up using a switch statement to increase readability. This splits the 
special functionality for each level into its own block of code, greatly increasing readability. Overall this is a very readable class.
