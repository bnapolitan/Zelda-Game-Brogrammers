Comment:
In this file, functions are mainly focused on the allocation of key board’s controller and some
animated sprites. All these functions’ names are easy to under. Other programmers can easily
know what these functions can do. However, especially for the key board controllers, it may
not be very suitable for this file. They may need to be implemented in the game specific
controller’s file. To sum up, all these functions are easy to read.
