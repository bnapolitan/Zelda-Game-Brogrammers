	This file manages the creation of HUDs. It adds elements to the HUD list, updates those elements, and draws them to the screen. 

	It sets some variables with list type to public, which makes other files can access those variables.

	Some variables, such as numHearts and maxHearts, which should only be used in this file, are set to private. This makes this file have better code quality.

	Those codes are brief enough, unless there are some registrations for lists, such as in the method UpdateCounters, which cannot be avoided.

	Good and clear use of if-condition and while-loop inside UpdateHearts(), which calculates the number of hearts accurately and update it accordingly.	
	
	I think this file is of good quality and does not have anything to be changed.
