Code Quality Comments: 

	- Good use of lists to store elements of interest for different purposes

	- Access to instance of FinalGame and Link directly creates some coupling
		-could be reduced with a utility class that keeps track of Link's information

	- Most methods are clear and have a single purpose

	- Register game seems to call methods which perform other takss, resulting in slightly lowered cohesion

	- In general, cohesion and coupling is pretty good for the class and all the information it requires

	- Other than improvements suggested above, class looks good
