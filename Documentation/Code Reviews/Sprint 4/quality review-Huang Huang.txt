If programmers need to add sprite and create new link between keyboard and new action
commend, it should be easy to add new functions. However, if programmers want to do 
some change on controllers, they will search these keyboard allocations in the controllers' 
file. As for this implement, it may not be suitable in this file. It will cause some difficulties 
for programmers to change controller. Because this file contains some very simple and 
basic files, it should not be hard to make new implementations.
