Comments on Readability:

	- Lists and variables in class are clearly named, making purpose cleaer

	- Update method seems very simple, with all counters and health updated appropriately

	- Draw method uses lists to draw appropriate elements, easy to understand

	- RegisterGame calls other methods making it hard to understand what it fully does before more investigation

	-AddBaseElements clearly adds appropriate icons and shapes for display

	-Multiple Update methods for functions and MoveMapBlipDirection functions that are named so that purpose is clear

	-Overall, this file is very readable. The only slightly confusing thing is the blipCool variable, whose purpose is unclear at first
