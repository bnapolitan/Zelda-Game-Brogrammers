Comments on code maintainability/quality:
This file is well-placed, extending the BasePlayerProjectile abstract class and only writing functionality that is needed.

OnCollide and Launch are short and take care of the functionality needed for them.

Update is a little longer but does what is attributed to it. There is a magic number on line 58/59 that could be organized elsewhere but besides that the flow is necessary and understandable.

The constructor is the starting point for playing the sound effect which doesn't seem to be an action a constructor should perform (i.e. a boomerang object could be created but not thrown yet)

Besides that I see no issues in quality for this file.


Hypothetical change:
move ".5f" to be a private readonly variable at the top of the class.
Place "SoundHandler.Instance.PlaySoundEffect("Boomerang");" somewhere in a function.
