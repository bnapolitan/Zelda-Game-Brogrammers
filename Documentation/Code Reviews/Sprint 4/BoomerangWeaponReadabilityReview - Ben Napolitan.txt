Comments:
Variables are well-named and functions take care of functionality contained under their name which makes this file easily readable.

The Update() function is the only function that is a little long and it takes a little time in order to understand what it does. Maybe the distance functionality can be moved into a private function called HandleBoomerangMovement().
